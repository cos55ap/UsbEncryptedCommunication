# Usb_VCP_EncryptedCommunication
USB encrypted communication between PC and Embedded Hardware via USB - Virtual Com Port.

With this Open Project you can implement an encryption communication between PC and a USB board.

This project was a prototype proposal to Bank Hardware Supplier having as scope implementation on bank hardware equipment (to increase their equipment security level).

For financial reason the project never ended to be introduced in production. In consequence I have decided to improve it making it open to the public.
